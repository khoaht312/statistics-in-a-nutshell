# Experimental Design
- [x] Questioning:  You may notice an anomaly in the data you are using for something else, which may cause you to want to know more about the data
- [x] Hypothesis: What will change? / How will it change? / What will cause the change?
- [x] Required Variables: we call the variable that we manipulate an independent variable. The variable whose effect we measure is called a dependent variable
- [x] Choosing a Measurement Approach
- [x] Selecting an Analysis
