# Experimental Design
- [x] Questioning:  You may notice an anomaly in the data you are using for something else, which may cause you to want to know more about the data
- [x] Hypothesis: What will change? / How will it change? / What will cause the change?
- [x] Required Variables: we call the variable that we manipulate an independent variable. The variable whose effect we measure is called a dependent variable
- [x] Choosing a Measurement Approach
- [x] Selecting an Analysis

# Hypothesis Testing and A/B Tests
- [x] Hypothesis tests are framed in terms of the question: “Is there a  difference?” And, this question actually implies two possible answers, or two hypotheses: <br>
(H0) No, there is no difference between population A and population B. <br>
(H1) Yes, there is a difference between population A and population B. <br>
- [x] A/B Tests: A/B testing refers to studies in which two or more versions of a variable (e.g., a web page, an advertisement, a design element, etc.) are shown to different populations of users to determine which version has the most impact in meeting business goals.
# Being Accurate: Avoiding Bias
**Survey Bias**
- [x] Order Bias: The sequence of questions or answers can influence responses. People tend to choose the first answer listed more frequently. Additionally, if asked early about liking a company, respondents might favor that company in subsequent questions. Modern survey software often mitigates this by randomizing question and answer order.

- [x] Leading Questions: Questions can be phrased to lead respondents toward a desired answer. For example, "Would you prefer the delightful product A or the disgusting product B?" clearly biases the respondent. To avoid this, carefully review questions to ensure neutrality.

- [x] Recall Bias: This happens when people inaccurately remember past events or details. This bias is influenced by the respondent's memory and willingness to report accurately. To minimize recall bias, avoid asking participants to recall past events. If necessary, keep such questions brief, specific, and in multiple-choice format.

**Culture Bias**
- [x] Making sure the people giving the surveys are from the local culture, or are at least very familiar with it.
- [x] Making sure the tests are translated for intent and not just a direct translation.
- [x] Using localization groups to make sure the data is appropriate for that area.

**Confirmation Bias**
- [x] Never go into your survey with a mindset that you are trying to prove one side or another

**Observation Bias**
- [x]  if someone is being watched, they may give answers they think they should give, and not their true answers

**Selection Bias**
- [x] When your selection of participants does favor subsets of the population, this leads to a survey bias known as selection bias

# False Positives and False Negatives
- [x] Type I Errors
- [x] Type II Errors
