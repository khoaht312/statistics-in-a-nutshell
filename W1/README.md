# Descriptive Statistics

**Measures of Central Tendency**
> Số đo tập trung
- [x] Including **mean**, **median**, **mode** of a set of data values.
- [x] Finding the middle of a dataset.

**Mean**
> Giá trị trung bình
- [x] The average value of dataset's data.
- [x] Mean is the best used when data is recorded regularly (daily averages, ...)
- [x] For data characterizing grouped values, the mean is best used when there are no significant outliers.

**Median**
> Giá trị trung vị
- [x] If you have significant outliers in a group of data values.
- [x] Median is the exact middle of the dataset after sorting all the numbers from smallest to largest.
- [x] If there is an even numer of entries, median is the average of the two numbers in the middle. 8 -> (4,5) -> 5

**Mode**
> Giá trị yếu vị
- [x] The value that occurs most frequently.
- [x] Useful when looking at frequencies of categories.
- [x] Multiple modes -> Bimodal, more than two modes -> Multimodal

**Measures of Dispersion**
> Số đo độ phân tán

**Variance**
- [x] The variance within a dataset, how "spread out" data points are from the mean of the dataset.

**Range**
- [x] Range is just the differnece between the highest value and the lowest value in a dataset (Max - Min).
- [x] How a large range reflects a higher degree of variance.

  **Standard Deviation**
- [x] STD is more precise measure of dispersion, give a specific range of values that captures a specific percentage of dataset.

**Z-Scores**
- [x] How far a certain value if from the mean of a dataset, how it compares to the observed distribution of values within that set.
- [x] Z-score = (Value - Mean) / STD

**Frequency**
> Tần suất, tần số
- [x] The number of times a value occurs in a data set.

**Frequency Tables**
- [x] Visualize the number of times each value in a set is recored and is a great way to describe categorical data.

**Contingency Tables**
- [x] Look at multiple categoricacl variables at the same time.

**Correlation**
- [x] A measure is calculated to show how two variables are related.

**Scatter Plots**
- [x] Key tool for visualizing the correlation between two variables.

**Correlation Coefficient**
- [x] Measure correlation by degrees (How much correlation exists between wo variables).
