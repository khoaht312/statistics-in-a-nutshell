# Descriptive Statistics

**Measures of Central Tendency**
> Số đo tập trung
- [x] Including **mean**, **median**, **mode** of a set of data values.
- [x] Finding the middle of a dataset.

**Mean**
> Giá trị trung bình
- [x] The average value of dataset's data.
- [x] Mean is the best used when data is recorded regularly (daily averages, ...)
- [x] For data characterizing grouped values, the mean is best used when there are no significant outliers.

**Median**
> Giá trị trung vị
- [x] If you have significant outliers in a group of data values.
- [x] Median is the exact middle of the dataset after sorting all the numbers from smallest to largest.
- [x] If there is an even numer of entries, median is the average of the two numbers in the middle. 8 -> (4,5) -> 5

**Mode**
> Giá trị yếu vị
- [x] The value that occurs most frequently.
- [x] Useful when looking at frequencies of categories.
- [x] Multiple modes -> Bimodal, more than two modes -> Multimodal

**Measures of Dispersion**
> Số đo độ phân tán

**Variance**
- [x] The variance within a dataset, how "spread out" data points are from the mean of the dataset.

**Range**
- [x] Range is just the differnece between the highest value and the lowest value in a dataset (Max - Min).
- [x] How a large range reflects a higher degree of variance.

  **Standard Deviation**
- [x] STD is more precise measure of dispersion, give a specific range of values that captures a specific percentage of dataset.

**Z-Scores**
- [x] How far a certain value if from the mean of a dataset, how it compares to the observed distribution of values within that set.
- [x] Z-score = (Value - Mean) / STD

**Frequency**
> Tần suất, tần số
- [x] The number of times a value occurs in a data set.

**Frequency Tables**
- [x] Visualize the number of times each value in a set is recored and is a great way to describe categorical data.

**Contingency Tables**
- [x] Look at multiple categoricacl variables at the same time.

**Correlation**
- [x] A measure is calculated to show how two variables are related.

**Scatter Plots**
- [x] Key tool for visualizing the correlation between two variables.

**Correlation Coefficient**
- [x] Measure correlation by degrees (How much correlation exists between wo variables).

# Inferential Statistics

**Sampling**
- [x] carefully selected subset of the population that is intended to represent the whole
- [x] if your sample size is large enough, then the mean and standard deviation of your sample will be the same as the mean and standard deviation of your population

Four Normalizing Transformations
- [x] Logarithmic Transformation: To find the logarithmic transformation for a numeric dataset, apply this formula to every value n in the set: =LOG10(n). You can then create a histogram for all these logarithmic values.

- [x] Cube Root Transformation: The formula for the cube root, in Excel and Google Sheets, is =n^(1/3). To find the cube root transformation, apply this cube root formula to every value n in your dataset and create a histogram for all these cube root values.

- [x] Square Root Transformation: Likewise, the formula for the square root is =SQRT(n). To find the square root transformation, apply the square root formula to every value n in your dataset and create a histogram for all these square root values.

- [x] Square Transformation: Finally, the formula for the square of a number is =n^2. To find the square transformation, apply the squaring formula to every value n in your dataset and create a histogram for all these squared values.
